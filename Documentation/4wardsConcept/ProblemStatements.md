# Problem statements
Here we will imagine an INDEPENDENT LEARNER looking to maintain consistent
progress while learning a NEW LANGUAGE. 

1. <i>Problems and Solutions of:  CHECKBOXES </i>

>- <i>Problem: </i> Checkboxes exist to be checked off. A user's mind automatically
begins looking for the shortest path to do just that. But there aren't really
any shortcuts in language learning, and if you spend less time, you'll likely
learn less. 
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - ENCOURAGE A USER TO SPEND MORE TIME RATHER THAN LESS</i>
        
>- <i>Problem: </i> Checkboxes don't generate a pleasurable feeling until you 
check them off. Short sessions that don't check off any boxes are
inherently discouraged, even when they could be very helpful.
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - REWARD ANY AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT BY SHOWING HOW
>SMALL SESSIONS ADD UP
>   - ENCOURAGING A USER TO START EARLY</i>

>- <i>Problem: </i> Big tasks and small ones are rewarded the same way—with 
>a checked box. A user is encouraged to do the easy tasks first.
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - REWARD EFFORT (effort = (time + focus)/time)
>   - ENCOURAGE SAVING EASY WORK FOR LAST
>   - MOTIVATE "EXTRA CREDIT"</i>

>- <i>Problem: </i> 
>   - Checkboxes depend on knowing the steps ahead of time. When 
>using a checkbox system, a user struggles to start without having steps clearly
>drawn out. This prompts one to make a sequence of steps that may turn out 
>to be incorrect, or worse yet, giving up before starting. 
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - DISCOURAGE THE PLANNING OF "STEP TWO" UNTIL 
>"STEP ONE" IS ALMOST DONE, SAVING TIME AND REDUCING FRUSTRATION</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> While language learning doesn't render impressive results 
>quickly, to-do lists tempt a user to list ultra-impressive goals
>- <i>A solution would: WEAN A USER OFF THE NEED FOR IMPRESSIVE (BOAST-WORTHY) 
>RESULTS IN FAVOR OF GOOD, CONSISTENT WORK

1. Problem of new years resolutions

>- <i>Problem: </i>Goals are much more fun to make than they are to complete. 
>It's easy to celebrate a victory you haven't achieved yet, and unless you execute 
 >perfectly then the best part is over once you've created the list. This also 
>applies to checkboxes in general.
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - KEEP IT SMALL BY FOCUSING ON SINGLE DAYS RATHER THAN YEARS
>   - ENCOURAGE A USER TO FOCUS ON DOING THINGS RATHER THAN DREAMING ABOUT
>HAVING DONE THINGS
></i>

1. <i>Problems and Solutions of: POMO TIMERS</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> Pomos have fixed durations. They are built on the notion that
>20-minute or 25-minute segments are the ideal amount of time for a human to focus.
>But sometimes, you're already in the zone when you start, but you only have 10 
>minutes. So you can't use a pomo. 
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - ATTRIBUTE WORK QUALITY TO MULTIPLE FACTORS, AND PROVIDE
>A MORE FLEXIBLE WAY FOR A USER TO RECORD HIGH QUALITY PROGRESS</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> While a clocked Pomo supposedly indicates a highly focused 
>session, that's not necessarily the case, and a user ends up recording pomos
>finished which don't deserve to be considered focused time blocks.
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - PROMPT THE USER TO RATE LEVEL OF FOCUS AT END OF 
>SESSION</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> It is difficult to start a Pomo, due to unfavorable 
>disposition, and this may lead to not starting at all.
>- <i>A solution would: 
>   - ENCOURAGE USER TO START WORKING, EVEN THOUGH THE WORK MIGHT NOT BE IDEAL
>   - MAKE CLEAR TO THE USER THAT ABSOLUTELY ANY WORK CAN BE RECORDED AND 
>APPRECIATED LATER, NO MATTER THE QUALITY, AND IT ALL ADDS UP
></i> 

1. <i>Problems and Solutions of: MOST TIME-TRACKING SOFTWARE</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> All time recorded is treated equally.
>- <i>A solution would: PROMPT USER FOR ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PROPERLY
>RATE THE TIME SPENT AND MEASURE PROGRESS</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> 
>   - Sometimes, when you start a session, you don't know what 
>you'll end up working on, and some time-trackers associate clock-time to 
>only one topic.
>   - Many time trackers only allow association of clock time to topics by 
>means of tags. This doesn't allow unequal allotment of clock time in a single
>session. 
>- <i>A solution would: ALLOW DIVISION OF CLOCK-TIME BETWEEN MULTIPLE TOPICS 
>AT CLOCK-OUT</i> 
1. <i>Problems and Solutions of: EXCEL</i> 

>- <i>Problem: </i> Being a powerful tool, it's difficult to learn and tedious 
>to use—not well-suited for most personalities.
>- <i>A solution would: PROVIDE A GUI WITH A REDUCED USE CASE</i>
