  <p align="center">
    A utility for tracking time, effort, and productivity.
    <br />
  </p>

## What is 4wards?
### Application type
4wards will be a cross-platform GUI application with local persistence, 
connected to a cloud-based relational database of user data.
 
### Concept
It's an effort tracker designed specifically for the independent worker or 
learner. What sets it apart is its clock-out dialogue, 
which allows a user to easily associate a work session with <i>multiple</i> 
work topics and record specific info about productivity. Through these
and other features, 4wards points towards specific types of work 
where outcome-related goal-making may be impractical. 

More info is available in the Documentation directory, to which there is a 
guide provided below.

## Progress

This application is under construction. Various experiments with 
potential features can be found at these locations:
-![4wardsPOC1a](https://github.com/tunepruner/4wards_POC1.a_MultiList)
-![4wardsPOC1b](https://github.com/tunepruner/4wards_POC1.b_editor)
-![4wardsPOC1c](https://github.com/tunepruner/4wards_POC1.c_navigation)

This, being the main repo, has no implimentation yet. 
It is transitioning from the design stage to the test plan stage. 
My goal is to apply TDD techniques to maximize technical agility.
The documentation is the current focus.
